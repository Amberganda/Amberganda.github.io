This rails project was postponed by me for personal reasons. I was on vacation in December & I didn't have enough time to catch up on it when I got back. Unfortunately, that process of travelling, coming back home, and back to work with all of my responsibilities put on hold totally set me back. I'm happy to be back, programming & having life semi-return back to normal. 

The inspiration of my project was set into effect during this COVID-19 lock down. I have to say, for me it has been easier for me to program as all of my external obligations have passed (aside from my job). Now I really want to travel when this is over. In hindsight, I wasn't able to write things down about my trip. This is where the travel diary/blog came to terms. 

I think the hardest part of this project for me is coming up with an idea that conforms to the relationship requirements that I needed to fulfill; Includes at least one has_many, includes one belongs_to, includes 2 has_many through, and includes at least one many-to-many relationship. With all the uncertainty around, I was really having a hard time focusing. I was fortunate to have some time to spend with my cohort lead, Lance. He told me about a website called [Lucid Chart](http://www.lucidchart.com). This website has been an amazing tool to visualize my Models & to make sure that they satisfy the requirements above. I was able to come up with this: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amberganda/travel_diary/master/RAILS%20PROJECT.png)

This was probably the best thing for me to visualize all of my requirements, prior to writing a bunch of code, going off the rails (no pun intended), and having to revise my MVCs. In the future, I will go this route prior to building. 

Once I got that out of the way, I pretty much got my project up and running, taking the specs step by step. I think the hardest part for me was OmniAuth & Devise. I had never used either of these gems prior to this project. I admit that using them really streamlined the process once I got it up and running. But in all honesty, I ran into some serious hurdles. I found [this tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/@anaumov/rails-omniauth-with-devise--github-example-du107rmn7) helpful when I didn't think I could get it to work. I couldn't imagine doing this without the web. I googled countless times. In hindsight, I think that my googling skills are also improving. Never thought that would be such an invaluable skill!
